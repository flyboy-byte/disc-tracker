# Disc Tracker — Mobile Port Plan

> Phased implementation plan. Each phase is independently completable and testable.
> The website is the spec — do not change disc suggestion behavior, flight model, or
> stability logic unless a bug is proven and explicitly marked as a fix.
>
> Hard constraints throughout:
> - Do not rewrite the physics model (port it as `legacyPhysics.ts`, improve separately)
> - Do not invent new formulas or change flight number interpretation
> - Do not add cloud backup, analytics, Firebase, Sentry, OAuth, or ads
> - Do not make the app depend on the Flask server
> - Local-only v1. Single-user UX. Android-first.
> - Do not work ahead — complete and verify each phase before starting the next
> - Physics V2, VPS sync, and F-Droid distribution are explicitly out of scope until v1 APK is proven

## Minimum Credible v1 Milestone

> This is the real finish line for v1. Not Play Store. Not F-Droid. Not Physics V2.

- [ ] Expo app opens cold on a physical Android device without crashing
- [ ] SQLite persists a bag across app kills (add disc → kill app → reopen → disc still there)
- [ ] Stability labels on disc cards match the website for the same disc
- [ ] Phase 0 parity tests pass (stability, distance, scenario filters)
- [ ] Flight Shape arc renders and updates when sliders move
- [ ] Disc Suggest shows correct bag matches for at least Roller and Max Distance scenarios
- [ ] CSV export produces a file, CSV import reads it back correctly

Everything after this — Play Store submission, F-Droid, Physics V2, sync — is a separate job.

## Phase 0 — Parity Test Fixtures

> Before writing any app code, define known-good input/output pairs from the **running website**.
> These are the acceptance criteria that prove the mobile port matches website behavior.

Run each test case on the website, capture the exact output, record it here.

### 0A — Stability Classification Fixtures

| Disc | Speed | Glide | Turn | Fade | Net (fade+turn) | Expected label |
|------|-------|-------|------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Aviar | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 | +1 | OS |
| Leopard3 | 7 | 5 | -2 | 1 | -1 | US |
| Destroyer | 12 | 5 | -1 | 3 | +2 | OS |
| Sonic (putter) | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 | +4 | OS |
| Roadrunner | 9 | 5 | -4 | 1 | -3 | US |
| Buzz | 5 | 4 | -1 | 2 | +1 | OS |
| River | 7 | 7 | -1 | 1 | 0 | ST |

**Expected formula:** `stability = fade + turn`. OS ≥ 1, US ≤ -1, ST = anything in between (strictly greater than -1 and less than 1).

> **Correction:** Leopard3 net = -1, which satisfies `≤ -1`, so it is US — not ST. Previous label "ST (boundary)" was wrong and would have encoded a contradiction into the parity tests. Verify on the website before porting.

### 0B — Distance Estimate Fixtures

Test `estimateDist()` with known inputs. Capture from the website's distance bar.

> **Correction (verified 2026-07-20 against `estimateDist()` in `flightshape.html` directly —
> pure function, no server round-trip needed, so computing it is equivalent to reading it off
> the site):** the previous "~" values were unrounded approximations that didn't match what the
> function actually returns (it rounds to the nearest 10ft at the end). Most were off by 5-10ft;
> the hyzer row was off by 32ft (342 vs the real 310) — a real arithmetic error, not just
> rounding. Values below are exact, not approximate.

| Disc (speed) | Arm% | Wind | Glide | Nose° | Hyzer° | Expected dist (ft) |
|-------------|------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Aviar (spd 2) | 100 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 120 |
| Leopard3 (spd 7) | 100 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 260 |
| Destroyer (spd 12) | 100 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 380 |
| Destroyer (spd 12) | 50 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 190 |
| Destroyer (spd 12) | 100 | +15 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 330 (headwind) |
| Destroyer (spd 12) | 100 | 0 | 5 | +10 | 0 | 320 (nose up) |
| Destroyer (spd 12) | 100 | 0 | 5 | 0 | +30 | 310 (hyzer) |

**Formula (verified against source):** `Math.round(baseFt*(arm/100)*(0.85+glide*0.03)*(1-wind*0.008)*noseFactor*hyzerFactor/10)*10`, where `baseFt = 80 + speed*25`. The final round-to-nearest-10 step is easy to miss when hand-deriving fixtures — port it exactly, don't drop it.

### 0C — Arc Path Shape Fixtures

Not exact SVG strings — shape class labels. Set up each throw on the website and record the stability badge shown on the adjusted disc.

| Disc | Arm% | Hyzer° | Nose° | Wind | Spin% | Expected adjusted stability |
|------|------|--------|-------|------|-------|----------------------------|
| Destroyer (12/5/-1/3) | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100 | OS (net +2) |
| Destroyer (12/5/-1/3) | 40 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100 | More OS (underpowered) |
| Roadrunner (9/5/-4/1) | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100 | US (net -3) |
| Roadrunner (9/5/-4/1) | 100 | +20 | 0 | 0 | 100 | Less US (hyzer counters turn) |
| Roadrunner (9/5/-4/1) | 100 | 0 | 0 | +15 | 100 | More US (headwind reveals turn) |
| Leopard3 (7/5/-2/1) | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 30 | More US (low spin → less gyro) |

### 0D — Scenario Filter Fixtures

For each scenario, record which of these 5 discs appear in bag results:

Test discs:
- **A:** Aviar (2/3/0/1) — net +1, Putt & Approach
- **B:** Buzz (5/4/-1/2) — net +1, Mid Range
- **C:** Leopard3 (7/5/-2/1) — net -1, Control Driver
- **D:** Destroyer (12/5/-1/3) — net +2, Distance Driver
- **E:** Roadrunner (9/5/-4/1) — net -3, Distance Driver

| Scenario | Expect A | Expect B | Expect C | Expect D | Expect E |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Dead Straight | ❌ speed<4 | ✅ | ✅ (net=-1 boundary) | ❌ net>1 | ❌ net<-1 |
| Reliable Hyzer | ❌ fade=1 | ❌ fade=2 | ❌ fade=1 | ✅ fade=3,turn≥-1 | ❌ fade=1,turn=-4 |
| Max Distance | ❌ spd<11 | ❌ spd<11 | ❌ spd<11 | ✅ spd≥11,fade≤3,turn≤-0.5 | ❌ spd=9<11 |
| Tailwind | ❌ spd<9 | ❌ spd<9 | ❌ spd<9 | ❌ net=+2, fails net≤0 | ✅ spd≥9,turn≤-1,net≤0 |
| Turnover | ❌ turn=0 | ❌ turn=-1 | ✅ turn=-2,fade=1,net=-1 | ❌ turn=-1 | ✅ turn=-4,fade=1,net=-3 |
| Roller | ❌ turn=0 | ❌ turn=-1 | ❌ turn=-2 not ≤-3 | ❌ turn=-1 | ✅ turn=-4,fade=1≤1 |

> Verified 2026-07-20 against the real `bagTest` predicates in `discsuggestion.html`'s
> `SCENARIOS` array (12 scenarios exist there; this table samples 6, which is fine for parity
> coverage).

> **Correction:** Destroyer's Tailwind rejection was previously noted as "turn=-1 not ≤-1" which is mathematically false (-1 ≤ -1 is true). The real reason Destroyer fails Tailwind is `net = +2`, which fails `net ≤ 0`. The comment bug matters — if copied into code or test comments it would describe the wrong condition.

> **Correction:** Leopard3's Turnover cell was marked ❌ despite the table's own reasoning
> proving all three conditions true (`turn=-2 ≤ -2` ✅, `fade=1 ≤ 2` ✅, `net=-1 ≤ -1` ✅) —
> the symbol just hadn't been updated to match. Leopard3 **does** match Turnover; fixed above.

---

## Phase 1 — Expo Scaffold ✅ done (2026-07-20)

**Goal:** Blank Expo project with navigation, theme, and bundled assets. No business logic yet.

> All deliverables below verified end-to-end on this machine's existing toolchain (JDK 21,
> Android SDK 36, NDK 27.1.12297006 — already installed, no setup needed): `./gradlew
> assembleDebug` produced a real signed APK (`com.disctracker.app`, target SDK 36), confirmed
> zero GMS/Firebase/Play Services dependencies via `./gradlew app:dependencies`. Expo SDK 57
> (satisfies "54+"), expo-router for the bottom tab shell, `src/theme.ts` ported from
> `static/style.css`'s real token values. No EAS anywhere in the pipeline. Next: Phase 2 (port
> pure utility functions), verified against the Phase 0 fixtures above.

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/disc_tracker
npx create-expo-app app --template blank-typescript
cd app
npx expo install expo-sqlite expo-router react-native-svg \
  @react-native-community/slider react-native-gesture-handler \
  react-native-reanimated react-native-draggable-flatlist \
  expo-file-system expo-sharing expo-document-picker
cp ../static/discs_master.json assets/

# Generate the android/ bare project and commit it immediately
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean
git add android/
```

**Deliverables:**
- `app.json` with `slug`, `android.package = "com.disctracker.app"`, SDK 54+
- `android/gradle.properties` with `-Xmx4g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g` JVM args (add before first build)
- `android/app/build.gradle` signing config reading from env vars (never commit credentials)
- `src/theme.ts` with all color constants matching web CSS vars
- Bottom tab navigator: Bag / Flight Shaper / Disc Suggest
- `npx expo start` runs without errors
- `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease` produces an APK signed with your key

**Package manager:** `npm` at repo root. No pnpm, no workspace, no monorepo subdir. Flat `node_modules`.

**Required toolchain:** JDK 21 OpenJDK (not Temurin), Android SDK 36, NDK 27.1.12297006.

**No EAS.** All builds — dev client and release — run through local Gradle (`./gradlew`), matching DragTree's setup. No `eas.json`. iOS is out of scope for now.

**Do not yet:** write any disc logic, DB calls, or screen content.

---

## Phase 2 — Port Pure Utility Functions ✅ done (2026-07-20)

**Goal:** All pure logic functions in TypeScript, tested against Phase 0 fixtures.

Files created (all in `src/utils/`):
- `disc.ts` — `stab()`, `discType()`, `stabClass()`, `stabShort()`, `bagToDisc()`, `typeShort()`, `MASTER_TYPE_LABEL`
- `legacyPhysics.ts` — `MOD`, `applyModifiers()`, `arcPoints()`, `estimateDist()` — exact port, no changes
- `scenarios.ts` — the real 12-entry `SCENARIOS` array (not a subset) + `filterBag()`, `filterLibrary()`
- `csv.ts` — `buildCSV()`, `parseCSV()`, `discKey()`, `previewImport()` (dedupe + `MAX_IMPORT` cap, matching the website's current behavior — this didn't exist yet when this phase was originally scoped, so it's slightly more than the plan's original `exportCSV()`/`importCSV()` naming, but same behavior)

**Verification:** Jest (`ts-jest`, `jest.config.js` at the `app/` root) with `*.test.ts` files beside each module, asserting the exact Phase 0 fixture inputs/outputs from PORT_PLAN.md §0A-§0D — including the corrected distance values and the Leopard3/Turnover fix. `npm test` — **48/48 passing**, matched the live website's math on the first real run with zero discrepancies (Phase 0's verification-before-porting approach paid for itself here).

**Not done yet, correctly deferred:** connecting any of this to a screen or a database — that's Phases 3+.

---

## Phase 3 — SQLite Schema and CRUD ⚠️ code done, not verified on-device (2026-07-20)

**Goal:** Database layer identical to Flask backend behavior.

> `src/db/migrations.ts` and `src/db/db.ts` are written and typecheck clean, matching
> `app.py`'s `init_db()` schema and migration list exactly — including `in_bag`, which this
> plan's schema section didn't have before now (a real gap, closed here). `saveDiscs()` is a
> full delete+reinsert, deliberately the same "replace this user's entire disc set" shape a
> future sync push/pull would need (see the comment at the top of `db.ts` and RESEARCH.md §2)
> — nothing about local-only v1 blocks adding sync later without a rewrite.
>
> **What's not done:** the verification checklist below (open → create user → save 3 discs →
> read back → delete-cascade) was written as a test but had to be deleted — `expo-sqlite` is a
> native module with no real SQL behavior under plain Node/Jest, so a test file that "passes"
> there wouldn't actually be testing anything. This needs an Android emulator or physical
> device to verify for real, which wasn't run this pass. Do that before starting Phase 4.

**Package:** `expo-sqlite` v14+ (built into Expo SDK 54) — native async/await, no community package needed.

Files: `src/db/db.ts` + `src/db/migrations.ts`

```typescript
// db.ts — must run on every connection:
db.execAsync('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON');

// Functions to implement:
openDatabase(): Promise<void>         // run migrations, set PRAGMA
getOrCreateDefaultUser(): Promise<number>   // v1: auto-create "My Bag" user
getDiscs(userId: number): Promise<Disc[]>
saveDiscs(userId: number, discs: Disc[]): Promise<void>   // bulk replace (same as POST /api/data)
getMeta(userId: number): Promise<UserMeta>
setMeta(userId: number, updates: Partial<UserMeta>): Promise<void>
```

**Migration pattern:** All schema versions live in `migrations.ts`, applied in sequence on app launch. Version the schema — don't just rely on `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS`. Same logic as Flask's `init_db()`: base tables first, then `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` for `color` and `arc_view`, each wrapped in try/catch.

**Verification:** Write a test that:
1. Opens DB
2. Creates default user
3. Saves 3 discs
4. Reads them back
5. Deletes user — confirms discs are gone (CASCADE working via PRAGMA)

---

## Phase 4 — Bag Screen

**Goal:** Full disc bag view matching `index.html` behavior.

**Features in priority order:**
1. Display disc list (cards with stability chip, flight numbers, color swatch) — **done**
2. Add disc from master library search — **done**
3. Edit disc (all fields) — **done**
4. Delete disc (confirm) — **done**
5. Sort modes (speed-desc, speed-asc, name, mfr, custom) — **done**
6. Drag-reorder (`react-native-draggable-flatlist`) — **built, not yet verified on-device**
   (custom sort mode wires it up; needs a real drag gesture test, not just a tap-based
   emulator check — `adb shell input swipe` or a physical device)
7. Search / filter by stability class or disc type — **done**
8. Color picker — **done**
9. CSV export — not started (moved to Phase 7, which owns the CSV parity check)
10. CSV import — not started (moved to Phase 7, which owns the CSV parity check)

**Web behavior to match:**
- Card shows: mfr, mold, plastic, weight, speed/glide/turn/fade, use_desc, notes, color, stability chip
- Stability chip: OS (purple), ST (green), US (amber) — using `stabClass()` / `stabShort()`
- Sort persisted to `user_meta.sort_mode`
- Custom sort order persisted to `discs.sort_order`

**Skip for v1:** Welcome modal (one-time tooltip shown to new users).

**Status (2026-07-23):** Items 1–5, 7, 8 built and verified end-to-end on a real Android
emulator (`src/components/DiscCard.tsx`, `DiscFormModal.tsx`, `DiscLibraryModal.tsx`,
`src/utils/masterLibrary.ts`, `src/utils/discColors.ts`, `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) —
display, add-from-library (with a real bug found and fixed: the form modal didn't
remount between a blank add and a library-prefilled add, so prefill silently no-opped;
fixed via an explicit remount-key counter), edit, delete-with-confirm, and SQLite
persistence across app kills all confirmed by hand on-device, not just typechecked.
Item 6 (drag-reorder) is wired up (`DraggableFlatList`, `GestureHandlerRootView` added
to `app/_layout.tsx`) but not yet drag-tested for real — `adb shell input tap` can't
simulate a drag gesture, so this needs a follow-up pass with a real swipe/drag input or
a physical device. CSV (9–10) intentionally deferred to Phase 7 below, which already
owns the CSV parity check against the website — building it here would be working
ahead of that phase's own verification step.

---

## Phase 5 — Flight Shape Screen

**Goal:** Flight simulator matching `flightshape.html` behavior.

**Features:**
1. Disc picker (from bag + manual number entry) — **done**
2. 5 sliders: hyzer (-30°..+30°), nose (-15°..+15° — this doc said -20..+20, but the live
   site's actual markup (`flightshape.html` `#sl-nose`) uses -15..+15; built to match the
   live site, not this doc, since website behavior is the parity source of truth), wind
   (-20..+20), arm (50–100%), spin (50–100%) — **done**
3. Arc SVG redraws on every slider change — **done**
4. Ghost arc shown when sliders deviate from default — **done**
5. Adjusted stability badge + flight numbers — **done**
6. Distance estimate bar — **done**
7. arcView selector (RHBH/RHFH/LHBH/LHFH) — persisted to `user_meta.arc_view` — **done**
8. Hyzer reference diagram (X-shaped SVG with disc silhouettes) — **done**
9. Side-view and back-view angle diagrams — **done**
10. Reset button — **done**

Physics-sim mode (server-side shotshaper, the "Physics sim (research)" toggle on the
website) was deliberately **not** ported — it requires a live network call to the Flask
server, which violates the hard constraint "do not make the app depend on the Flask
server." Only the legacy Bézier arc is in mobile v1.

**Key mapping decisions (updated from original plan, 2026-07-23):**
- Horizontal sliders: not needed — Flight Shaper has none (all 5 conditions sliders are
  vertical on the website too).
- Vertical sliders → `VerticalSlider.tsx`, but **not** via the originally-planned route.
  First attempt used a horizontal `@react-native-community/slider` rotated -90deg (the
  same CSS trick `flightshape.html` itself uses on a horizontal `<input type="range">`).
  That measurably failed on-device: nested inside a ScrollView, a real drag always got
  claimed as a page scroll instead of a thumb drag — confirmed with both plain
  `react-native`'s `ScrollView` and `react-native-gesture-handler`'s `ScrollView`, at both
  fast and slow drag speeds (so not a synthetic-input artifact). A native platform
  `Slider`'s touch-claim logic doesn't go through RNGH's gesture negotiation layer at
  all. Rebuilt as originally speced — **Reanimated 4 (`useSharedValue`) +
  `react-native-gesture-handler`'s `Gesture.Pan()`/`GestureDetector`** driving a plain
  `View` thumb/track directly — this actually resolves the conflict, since a
  GestureDetector-driven pan does go through RNGH's negotiation layer. Confirmed working
  on-device after switching. Two real bugs hit and fixed along the way: (1) plain helper
  functions called from inside the gesture's `onUpdate` worklet need their own
  `'worklet'` directive or Reanimated throws "Tried to synchronously call a Remote
  Function"; (2) syncing the shared value from the `value` prop must happen in a
  `useEffect`, not directly in the render body, or Reanimated's strict mode warns
  ("Writing to `value` during component render").
- `arcPoints()` output → `<Svg>` + `<Path>` in `react-native-svg` — as planned.
- `drawArc()` → `FlightArcSvg.tsx` (named slightly differently than the `ArcSvg.tsx`
  this doc originally proposed) — takes adjusted disc + base disc (for the ghost) +
  sliders + arcView, renders the full SVG.

**Parity check:** Load Destroyer (12/5/-1/3) at 100%/0°/0°/calm/100%. Arc should show slight right turn then firm left fade. Distance bar ~380ft. **Verified on-device 2026-07-23** with a 7/5/0/2 manual disc (not Destroyer specifically, but the same code path) — hyzer/arcView/distance/badge all update correctly and consistently with each other on a real drag gesture, not just a typecheck.

---

## Phase 6 — Disc Suggest Screen

**Goal:** Scenario recommendation matching `discsuggestion.html` behavior.

**Features:**
1. 12-scenario grid (2 columns mobile → 3 → 6 at wider widths)
2. Tap scenario → show bag matches + library matches
3. Bag matches: "In your bag" highlighted cards
4. Library matches: top 15 sorted by proximity to scenario midpoint stability, deduplicated against bag
5. Stability chip + stability bar on each card

**Master library:** Loaded from `assets/discs_master.json` via `require()` — no network call.

**Parity check:** Select "Roller" scenario. Only discs with `turn <= -3` and `fade <= 1` should appear in bag results.

---

## Phase 7 — Import / Export

**Goal:** CSV round-trip matches web behavior.

**Export fields (in order):** `mfr, mold, plastic, weight, speed, glide, turn, fade, use, thr, notes, color`

**Import behavior:**
- Parse header row to find column positions (order-agnostic)
- Strip leading `#` from color if present
- Assign new `disc_id` values (from `user_meta.next_id`)
- Append to current bag (do not clear existing discs)

**Mobile implementation:**
- Export: `expo-file-system` write temp file → `expo-sharing` share sheet
- Import: `expo-document-picker` pick `.csv` → read text → parse → insert into SQLite

**Parity check:** Export bag from web app, import CSV into mobile app. All discs appear with correct fields.

---

## Phase 8 — Android Build and Smoke Test

**Goal:** Real APK on a physical device, all screens verified. This phase ends at a working APK — Play Console and F-Droid submission are distribution tasks that follow, not part of this phase.

### 8A — Local Preview Build (sideload testing)

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
# APK is at android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/ — install via adb or direct transfer
```

`-PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a` overrides `gradle.properties`'
default (all 4 ABIs, kept for local emulator debug builds — this machine's AVDs are
x86_64) for real-device release builds only: real phones are arm64-v8a or, on older
hardware, armeabi-v7a — x86/x86_64 are emulator/Chromebook-only and just dead weight in
a release/sideload APK. Also cuts release build time roughly in proportion to the
number of native targets dropped. `android.enableMinifyInReleaseBuilds` and
`android.enableShrinkResourcesInReleaseBuilds` are also on now (`gradle.properties`) —
R8 + resource shrinking for release only, debug is unaffected.

**Smoke test checklist:**
- [ ] App opens cold — no crash
- [ ] Default user auto-created on first launch
- [ ] Bag screen loads empty bag
- [ ] Add a Destroyer from library search
- [ ] Stability chip shows OS (purple)
- [ ] Flight Shape: select Destroyer → arc visible → move hyzer slider → arc updates
- [ ] Distance bar shows ~380ft at 100% arm, flat, calm
- [ ] Disc Suggest: tap "Max Distance" → Destroyer appears in bag results
- [ ] Tap "Roller" → Destroyer does NOT appear (fade=3, not ≤1)
- [ ] Export CSV → share sheet appears with file
- [ ] Kill app → reopen → Destroyer still in bag (SQLite persistence confirmed)
- [ ] Play target SDK check: `aapt dump badging app.apk | grep sdkVersion` → `targetSdkVersion='35'`

### 8B — GMS / Proprietary Dependency Check

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew app:dependencies | grep -i 'gms\|firebase\|play-services'
# Must return nothing — any GMS dep blocks F-Droid distribution later
```

> Phase 8 ends here. The APK works, the parity checklist passes, GMS is clean. **Distribution is a separate track that starts after this.**

---

## Distribution Track (after Phase 8 APK is proven)

> These are not phases of the port — they are deployment infrastructure. Do not start until the minimum v1 milestone is met.
>
> **Sequence these in order. Do not run D1 and D2 in parallel.** From DragTree experience: Play Console and F-Droid each have their own gradle/signing/metadata problems. Debugging both at once means you cannot isolate which system is causing a given failure. Get Play Console internal testing fully working first, then start F-Droid. The app does not change between them — only the build pipeline and metadata do.

### D1 — Play Console (do this first)

```bash
# Local AAB build (not EAS)
cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
# Upload AAB to Play Console → Internal testing → Closed testing
```

Same ABI override as 8A — Play generates per-device split APKs from the AAB itself, so
there's no reason to ship x86/x86_64 native code in it either.

Resolve all Play Console requirements before touching F-Droid:
- Target SDK declaration
- Data Safety form
- Content rating (IARC)
- Privacy policy URL live on GitHub Pages
- App signing: upload keystore to Play App Signing via Play Console

Only move to D2 once an internal tester can install and run the app from Play Console.

### D2 — F-Droid Self-Hosted (after D1 is working)

F-Droid setup took significantly longer than Play Console on DragTree — different kind of pain (reproducible build expectations, metadata files, fdroidserver quirks, key decisions) vs Play Console's bureaucratic UI hoops. Do not underestimate it.

**The reproducible build reality (from DragTree):**
Local builds are the prerequisite — EAS cloud builds never matched F-Droid's Debian sandbox. Local builds close the gap as much as possible (same JDK flavor, same NDK version, flat npm). However: no React Native/Expo app is *known* to have achieved a full F-Droid byte-match. The goal is to get close enough that F-Droid's reviewer accepts it, not to guarantee a perfect bit-for-bit match.

**Reference APK workflow:**
1. Build locally with production keystore: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a`
2. Verify signing: `apksigner verify --print-certs app-release.apk` — SHA256 must match `AllowedAPKSigningKeys` in fdroiddata YAML
3. Tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`
4. Upload signed APK to GitHub releases as `disc-tracker-v1.0.0.apk`
5. Add `Binaries:` entry to fdroiddata YAML pointing at the GitHub release URL

**Self-hosted repo:**
Reuse DragTree's `fdroidserver` setup — same infrastructure, new app entry.

1. Add `metadata/com.disctracker.app.yml` to the F-Droid repo
2. Run fdroidserver update — APK appears in self-hosted repo
3. Verify install from F-Droid client using self-hosted repo URL

### D3 — Official F-Droid Index (after D2 is stable)

Weeks-long review process. Start submission early. Self-hosted (D2) covers distribution in the meantime. Local builds give the best shot at reproducibility verification — but be honest with the reviewer about Expo/RN's reproducibility limitations if they flag it. Do not let D3 block anything.

---

## Phase 9 — VPS Sync (v1.1, after v1 ships)

**Goal:** Optional manual sync between phone and the existing Flask website via the same `/api/data` endpoints.

**What this is NOT:** a cloud service, a third-party backend, a new database. It's the user's own VPS running the same Flask app that powers the website.

### Flask changes (minimal)

```python
# app.py — add token check to /api/data GET and POST
SYNC_TOKEN = os.environ.get('SYNC_TOKEN')

def check_sync_token():
    if SYNC_TOKEN and request.headers.get('Authorization') != f'Bearer {SYNC_TOKEN}':
        abort(401)

# Add to both /api/data routes:
check_sync_token()
```

### Mobile changes

Settings screen additions:
- Server URL field (e.g. `https://yoursite.com`)
- Token field (bearer token matching `SYNC_TOKEN` on VPS)
- "Push to server" button — sends local bag to server via `POST /api/data`
- "Pull from server" button — fetches server bag and overwrites local via `GET /api/data`
- Last synced timestamp display

```typescript
// sync.ts — the whole sync layer
async function pushToServer(url: string, token: string, discs: Disc[]) {
  await fetch(`${url}/api/data`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ discs })
  });
}

async function pullFromServer(url: string, token: string): Promise<Disc[]> {
  const res = await fetch(`${url}/api/data`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  const { discs } = await res.json();
  return discs;
}
```

**Conflict model:** none — full replace in the direction the user chose. For a single-user bag this is always correct.

### Before submitting v1.1 to Play Store or F-Droid official index

These must be resolved first (see `RESEARCH.md` Section 11 open questions):

- [ ] Research how other self-hosted sync apps (Obsidian, Nextcloud, Syncthing) word Play Store Data Safety form for opt-in user-controlled sync
- [ ] Write exact Data Safety form language for v1.1 — draft and review before submitting
- [ ] Update privacy policy with sync section
- [ ] Decide on token setup UX (env var on VPS? in-app pairing? auto-generated in Flask?)
- [ ] Consider publishing OpenAPI spec for sync endpoints in repo — makes "open API" claim concrete

## Scope Boundaries for v1

Keep v1 focused — these can be revisited after shipping:

| Defer to later | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| VPS sync | v1.1 — fully designed, don't build yet |
| Physics V2 (`physicsV2.ts`) | Build alongside, switch when validated against real throw data |
| Multi-user picker screen | Schema supports it; UI can wait |
| User login / OAuth | Not needed — sync uses a simple bearer token |
| Third-party analytics | Not planned |

**Technical musts** (these will cause real problems if skipped):
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on every SQLite connection — or CASCADE deletes silently fail
- Target API 35 — Play Store requirement as of Aug 31 2025; Expo SDK 54 handles it
- No GMS dependencies — required for F-Droid; check `./gradlew app:dependencies` before submitting
- Local dev build (`npx expo run:android`, not Expo Go, no EAS) once any native module is added
- Port `applyModifiers()` and `arcPoints()` exactly — improve via `physicsV2.ts`, not by editing the port
- Resolve sync privacy/Data Safety wording before v1.1 Play Store submission

---

## Physics V2 (Parallel Track — Not Blocking v1)

Build `physicsV2.ts` alongside the port, but do not switch the Flight Shape screen to V2 until:
1. `simulateFlight()` passes all Phase 0C arc shape fixtures
2. At least 10 real throw data points have been collected and used to tune `DEFAULT_FLIGHT_TUNING`
3. User explicitly approves the switch

See `RESEARCH.md` Section 7 for full V2 architecture and real-throw data collection format.

## Marshall Street Flight Path Images (Decision Track)

> Decision: **implement in v1.1, not v1.** The feature is compelling and the API is free, but it introduces a network dependency and design questions that should not block shipping. Document the decision here so it's ready to build.

### What the DiscIt API provides

Live REST API at `discit-api.fly.dev` — scrapes Marshall Street Disc Golf's interactive flight guide nightly.

```
GET /disc             → all discs
GET /disc?name=buzzz  → filter by field
GET /disc/:id         → single disc
```

Each disc record includes:

```json
{
  "id": "aa24b5ff-...",
  "name": "Destroyer",
  "brand": "Innova",
  "category": "Distance Driver",
  "speed": "12", "glide": "5", "turn": "-1", "fade": "3",
  "stability": "Overstable",
  "link": "https://www.marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/?s=destroyer&post_type=product",
  "pic": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/inbounds/2079719.webp",
  "color": "#2A290E",
  "background_color": "#F3EB09"
}
```

**Coverage:** 1,107 of 1,203 discs have a `pic` URL (~92%). The ~96 without are obscure/rare molds.

### What the `pic` images actually are

400×340 webp. White background. Left half: a colored arc on a coordinate grid (meters on Y, lateral % on X). Right half: disc name, brand, PDGA physical specs (diameter, height, rim depth/width, max weight, approval date), Marshall Street branding.

The arc is a real measured flight path from Marshall Street's own flight guide — not computed from flight numbers. RHBH only. No adjustments for conditions (wind, hyzer, etc.).

### What this adds to the app

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Reference flight image** | Show the MS image on the disc detail modal — the "official" arc from the manufacturer's data, not our approximation |
| **PDGA physical specs** | Diameter, height, rim dimensions, weight. Currently not shown anywhere in the app |
| **Store link** | "Buy at Marshall Street" link per disc — natural monetization-neutral feature |
| **5-tier stability label** | Very Understable / Understable / Stable / Overstable / Very Overstable — richer than our 3-tier OS/ST/US |
| **Flight path source toggle** | Let user choose: Marshall Street image (when online) vs computed arc (always available offline) |

### Is this over-engineered?

**The `pic` image alone: no.** It's a single image URL cached per disc. The implementation is:
1. Look up disc by name+brand in DiscIt API → get `pic` URL
2. Store URL in local SQLite alongside the disc
3. Show image in an expandable detail view

That's 50 lines of code and zero ongoing complexity.

**The flight path source toggle: maybe.** Showing the MS image *instead of* the computed arc in the Flight Shaper requires replacing the interactive SVG with a static image, which means losing hyzer/wind/arm adjustments for the MS mode. That's a real UX tradeoff.

**The right framing:** the MS image and the computed arc answer *different questions*:
- MS image = "what does this disc do at 100% power, RHBH, flat, calm" — a static reference
- Computed arc = "what does this disc do *given my throw conditions*" — interactive

They're not competing. Show both, in different places.

### Proposed feature design

**Show MS image in disc detail modal (always, when available):**
- User taps the arc SVG on a bag card → expand modal
- Existing computed arc at top (interactive, per throw conditions)
- Below it: "Marshall Street reference" section showing the `pic` image
- Falls back gracefully if `pic` is null or network unavailable — just shows nothing

**Settings toggle for Flight Shaper:**
```
Flight path source:
  ● Computed (offline, adjustable for conditions)  ← default
  ○ Marshall Street (requires internet, RHBH reference only)
```

When "Marshall Street" is selected:
- Flight Shaper shows the `pic` image instead of the computed SVG
- Sliders are hidden (they don't apply to a static image)
- A note: "Marshall Street reference — RHBH, full power, calm"
- If image fails to load or disc has no `pic`: auto-fall back to computed arc

**v1.1 implementation order:**
1. Add `ms_pic_url` column to discs SQLite table (migration, nullable)
2. On disc add/import: look up DiscIt API by name+brand, store `pic` URL if found
3. Show MS image in disc detail expand modal (read-only reference)
4. Add Settings screen with flight path source toggle
5. Flight Shaper respects the toggle

### API reliability and privacy

- DiscIt API is a third-party free service. It could go down, change, or disappear. **Never block the app on it.** Always fall back to computed arc.
- The API call is outbound from the device to `discit-api.fly.dev`. For F-Droid/FOSS claims: declare it in the privacy policy as "optional disc image fetching from a third-party service." No personal data is sent — only the disc name/brand.
- Cache `pic` URLs locally in SQLite after first fetch. Don't re-fetch on every launch.
- If the user has flight path source set to "computed," no call to DiscIt API is ever made.

### Decision summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Do this? | Yes — the `pic` images are genuinely cool and unique |
| Blocks v1? | No — v1.1 feature |
| Replace computed arc? | No — show both, for different purposes |
| Settings toggle needed? | Yes — Marshall Street is RHBH-only, offline users need computed arc |
| Over-engineered? | Not if scoped to `pic` display + optional toggle. Over-engineered if we try to parse the image or mix the two arcs |
| F-Droid safe? | Yes — network call is optional, no GMS, no proprietary SDK |
| Super cool? | Yes — official Marshall Street flight data alongside your adjusted arc is genuinely useful |

### Open questions before building

1. Does the DiscIt API's `pic` URL for a disc in `discs_master.json` match by name+brand? Need to verify matching logic — some disc names differ slightly between datasets (e.g. "Buzzz" vs "Buzzz OS").
2. Should we bundle a pre-fetched lookup table (name → pic URL) with the app, or always fetch live? Bundled = no network needed but gets stale; live = always current but requires connectivity on disc add.
3. The MS images have a white background. The app is dark-themed. Options: show image in a white-background card, invert the image (hacky), or accept the contrast mismatch.
4. The 5-tier stability label from DiscIt ("Very Overstable" etc.) — do we adopt it alongside or instead of the 3-tier (OS/ST/US)?
